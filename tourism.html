                    The caves were constructed in the first century by King Kharavela of Kalinga, ancient Odisha (approximately 209-after 170 BC).
                    The great Mauryan King Ashoka conquered Kharavela. Kharavela was a liberal when it came to religious matters, notwithstanding his Jainism.
                    Between the 7th and 12th centuries, Udayagiri, also known as Madhavapura Mahavihara, was a major Buddhist center.
                    Udayagiri's excavations partially uncovered a double-story monastic complex dating from the eighth century A.D.
                    Hathi Gumpha, Ananta Gumpha, Ganesha Gumpha, Jaya Vijaya Gumpha, Mancapuri Gumpha, Bagha/Vyaghra/Vyaghra Gumpha, and Sarpa Gumpha are all famous caves.

                    The gorgeous Shanti Stupa is a dome-shaped structure that has the footprints of Buddha and the Bodhi tree ornamented over itâ€™s the stone panels. You can also easily spot the image of Ashoka right above these panels. The image displays King Ashoka with his sword kept in front of Lord Buddha, signifying that he had reformed and left behind his desire for conquest.

In the same locality, there is a monastery named Saddharma Vihar Monastery that is also regularly visited by Buddhist followers. Apart from this, there is the temple of Dhavaleshwar. This temple was renovated in the year 1972 and is visited by both Hindu and Buddhist visitors. So, Shanti Stupa is not the only striking monument you get to visit when visiting Dhauli Giri. There are several sacred tourist attractions around it that further cement the significance of this location and warrant a visit.
